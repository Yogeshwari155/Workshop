You're describing a **multi-role web platform** that acts as a third party between **enterprises (organizers)** and **users (participants)** — like a centralized **workshop hosting and registration platform**.

Let’s define each user type, their role, and what they can access/do:

Would you like me to:

* Design the database schema?
* Build this as a new full-stack app (Next.js + Express)?
* Or add this multi-role feature to your current project?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
